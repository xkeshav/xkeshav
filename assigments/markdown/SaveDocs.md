   - Include a button to save these details locally on the device.
   - Implement a feature to view and edit the saved details.

2. **Download as Picture:**
   - Implement a feature to convert the saved details into an image.
   - Provide an option to download this image, making it easy for users to share their information when needed.

3. **Local Storage:**
   - Utilize the local storage of the device to save the entered details securely.
   - Ensure data persistence even if the user closes the app or restarts their device.

4. **Offline Functionality:**
   - Develop the PWA to function seamlessly without an internet connection.
   - Clearly communicate to the user when offline and guide them on how to use the app without connectivity.

5. **Security:**
   - Implement basic encryption techniques to secure the stored data on the device.
   - Apply best practices for handling sensitive information.

**Deliverables:**

1. Working PWA with the specified features.
2. Codebase hosted on a version control system (e.g., GitHub) with clear commit messages.
3. Brief documentation explaining the structure of the code, dependencies used, and any special considerations for deployment.

**Evaluation Criteria:**

1. Functionality: Does the app fulfill the specified requirements?
2. Usability: Is the user interface intuitive and easy to navigate?
3. Offline Capability: Does the app work seamlessly without an internet connection?
4. Security: How well is the user's sensitive information protected?
5. Code Quality: Is the code well-organized, documented, and follows best practices?

**Submission Guidelines:**
Submit the GitHub repository link and a short demo video showcasing the app's features.

**Important Note:**
Ensure the developer follows industry best practices and ethical considerations when dealing with sensitive personal information. Regularly update the mentor on progress and seek feedback to enhance the learning experience.
