**Intern Assignment: PWA Mobile App Development**

**Project Overview:**
Create a Progressive Web App (PWA) focused on fetching and displaying Indian Railways PNR status. The app should allow users to view their last PNR status even when offline. Additionally, incorporate features such as storing and displaying five important train details, setting alarms for Tatkal booking, and implementing specific timings for AC and sleeper classes.

**Tasks:**

1. **PNR Status Retrieval:**
   - Implement a functionality to fetch and display the current PNR status from a reliable API source.
   - Store the last PNR status locally to enable offline access.

2. **Train Details:**
   - Allow users to save and view details of five important trains, including station codes and timings.

3. **Offline Mode:**
   - Ensure the app can function seamlessly in offline mode, allowing users to access their last PNR status.

4. **Alarm for Tatkal Booking:**
   - Integrate a feature to set alarms for Tatkal booking for specific trains.
   - Implement separate alarm timings for AC (10 AM) and sleeper (11 AM) classes.

5. **User Interface:**
   - Design an intuitive and user-friendly interface for seamless navigation.
   - Incorporate a clean layout for displaying PNR status, train details, and alarm settings.

6. **Notification System:**
   - Implement push notifications to remind users of upcoming Tatkal booking times.

7. **Error Handling:**
   - Develop a robust error-handling mechanism to address issues related to network connectivity or API failures.

8. **Testing:**
   - Conduct thorough testing to ensure the app's reliability and responsiveness.
   - Test the app in various scenarios, including offline usage and alarm triggering.

9. **Documentation:**
   - Prepare detailed documentation outlining the app's architecture, functionalities, and usage instructions.

10. **Performance Optimization:**
    - Optimize the app's performance for faster load times and smoother user experience.

**Submission:**
Submit the following deliverables:

- Source code with proper comments and version control.
- Comprehensive documentation.
- Test cases and results.
- A brief presentation highlighting key features and implementation details.

**Note:** Ensure adherence to coding standards, security best practices, and scalability considerations throughout the development process. Feel free to reach out for clarifications or guidance. Good luck!

Good luck!
