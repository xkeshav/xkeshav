# Assignment Title: Bilingual Dictionary Web App

## Task Overview

Develop a bilingual dictionary web application that allows users to add and search for the meaning of Hindi and English words. Users should be able to add multiple meanings, examples, and pronunciation for each entry. The application should operate locally without internet search, and users can commit their progress to a GitHub repository.

## Tasks

### User Interface

Design a user-friendly interface with input fields for Hindi and English words, along with areas for meanings, examples, and pronunciation.
Create a section for displaying saved entries and a search bar for quick lookups.

### Add Word Functionality

Implement a feature that allows users to add new words with their meanings in both Hindi and English.
Include the option to add multiple meanings, example sentences, and pronunciation.

### Local Search

Develop a search function to find words within the locally stored dictionary.
Display the search results with meanings, examples, and pronunciation if available.

### Handle Duplicate

Ensure that the application prevents the addition of duplicate words. If a word already exists, prompt the user to update the existing entry.

### GitHub Repository

Create a GitHub repository for the project.
Commit regularly to showcase coding progress and adherence to coding standards.

### Optional Features

Include the option to edit or delete existing entries.
Provide a link for internet search in case a word is not found locally.

## Submission Guidelines

Share the GitHub repository link for evaluation.
Include a README file with instructions on how to run the application locally.
Ensure clear comments and documentation in your code.

### Evaluation Criteria

- Functionality of adding, searching, and displaying entries.
- Prevention of duplicate entries.
