# Internship Assignment: Image Search Functionality in Python

## Objective

Develop a Python-based image search algorithm that searches for details based on an input image. If results are found, display relevant details; otherwise, gracefully handle the case of no results. Additionally, ensure proper documentation for the code and push it to a GitHub repository.

## Tasks

### Image Search Algorithm

Implement an image search algorithm using a suitable image processing library (e.g., OpenCV).
Use a pre-trained model or an API for image recognition and feature extraction.

### Search Result Details

Display relevant details based on the image search results (e.g., image description, tags, or related information).

### Graceful Error and Exception Handling

Implement a mechanism to gracefully handle the scenario when no results are found.
Provide a user-friendly message explaining the absence of results.

### GitHub Repository

Create a GitHub repository for the project.
Commit the code with clear and concise commit messages.
Include a README.md file with instructions on how to set up and run the image search algorithm.

### Documentation

Document the code thoroughly, including explanations of functions, classes, and important code blocks.
Provide an overview of the image search algorithm and how it works.
Include any dependencies, setup instructions, and troubleshooting tips.

## Submission

Push the completed code to the GitHub repository.
Ensure that the README.md file contains all necessary information for someone new to the project.

## Evaluation Criteria

- Functionality of the image search algorithm.
- Clarity and completeness of documentation.
- Graceful handling of no-results scenario.
- Effectiveness of the search result details display.
- Clean and well-organized code.
- Proper utilization of version control (GitHub).

## Note

Feel free to use any suitable Python libraries or frameworks for image processing and recognition. The focus should be on creating a functional and well-documented image search algorithm. Good Luck
