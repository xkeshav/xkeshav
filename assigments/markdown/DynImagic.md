# Internship Assignment: DynImagic

## Objective

Create a Mobile application that utilizes AI to separate colors from a group image and generate individual images with the same pattern. Implement a user-friendly UI to display available designs and colors, allowing users to generate specific color images on demand.

## Requirements

1. **Image Processing with AI:**
   - Develop a function that takes two images as input: one with the pattern/design and another with a group of colors and patterns.
   - Use AI/image processing techniques to identify and separate different colors from the group image.
   - Generate separate images for each color, preserving the original pattern.

2. **User Interface (UI):**
   - Utilize a GUI library like Tkinter, PyQt, or any of your choice for the user interface.
   - Display a list of available designs along with the count of unique colors for each design.
   - When a user clicks on a design, dynamically show the associated colors and patterns.
   - Provide a button or interactive element to generate individual color images based on the user's selection.

3. **GitHub Repository:**
   - Set up a GitHub repository for the project.
   - Structure the repository with appropriate directories (e.g., code, documentation).
   - Include a README file with instructions on how to run the application, required dependencies, and any additional information for users and developers.

4. **Documentation:**
   - Document your code thoroughly.
   - Provide a brief explanation of the AI/image processing techniques used.
   - Clearly explain the structure of your UI and how it interacts with the image processing functions.

## Submission

1. Push the complete codebase to the GitHub repository.
2. Include a README.md file with clear instructions on how to set up and run the application.
3. Provide a short document explaining the AI techniques used for color separation.

## Evaluation Criteria

1. **Functionality (50%):**
   - Successful color separation and image generation.
   - User-friendly UI with design and color selection features.

2. **Code Quality (30%):**
   - Well-documented code.
   - Clear and modular structure.

3. **GitHub Repository (10%):**
   - Proper organization of files and directories.
   - A README file with comprehensive instructions.

4. **Documentation (10%):**
   - Concise documentation explaining the AI techniques used.
   - Clear instructions for users and developers.

## Note

Feel free to use any libraries or frameworks you find suitable for image processing and UI development. The goal is to create a functional and well-documented application that meets the specified requirements.
