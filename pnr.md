**Assignment Title: PWA Development for IRCTC PNR Status Checker**

**Objective:**
Create a Progressive Web Application (PWA) that allows users to search for Indian Railway PNR numbers, retrieve their current status online, and store the last status for offline access. Additionally, implement a feature to display a list of the last 10 searched PNR numbers, and handle errors gracefully.

**Requirements:**
1. **PNR Status Search:**
   - Integrate with the IRCTC API for retrieving real-time PNR status.
   - Provide a smooth and mobile-friendly user interface for entering and submitting PNR numbers.
   - Display the current status of the PNR including details like train name, departure/arrival stations, and seat information.

2. **Offline Mode:**
   - Implement offline functionality to store the last retrieved PNR status locally.
   - When the user is offline, show the last known status of the PNR.

3. **Search History:**
   - Maintain a list of the last 10 searched PNR numbers.
   - Display this list in a user-friendly way, allowing users to easily recheck previous PNR statuses.

4. **Error Handling:**
   - Implement robust error handling for scenarios such as expired or invalid PNR numbers.
   - Provide clear and informative error messages to guide the user in case of issues.

5. **Smooth UI:**
   - Design a visually appealing and intuitive user interface.
   - Ensure seamless interactions and transitions to enhance the overall user experience.

6. **Mobile-Friendly:**
   - Optimize the application layout for various screen sizes, particularly focusing on mobile devices.

7. **Documentation:**
   - Provide detailed documentation on how to set up the development environment, run the application, and any additional considerations for deployment.

**Submission:**
- Submit the source code along with necessary configuration files.
- Include documentation in markdown format.
- Share a live demo link for review.

**Evaluation Criteria:**
- Functionality: Does the application perform the required tasks accurately?
- User Interface: Is the UI intuitive, visually appealing, and mobile-friendly?
- Offline Support: How well does the application handle offline scenarios?
- Error Handling: Are errors handled gracefully, providing meaningful feedback?
- Code Quality: Is the code well-organized, readable, and follows best practices?
