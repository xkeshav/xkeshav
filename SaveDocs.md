Creating a complete offline Progressive Web App (PWA) with the specified features involves a variety of tasks. Below is a simplified assignment for a junior developer:

**Assignment: Offline PWA for Storing Personal Documents**

**Objective:**
Develop an offline PWA allowing users to securely store and manage their essential details such as Aadhar number, Driving License number, PAN card number, and Passport number. Additionally, users should be able to download these details as a picture for sharing and store them locally on their phones.

**Requirements:**

1. **User Interface (UI):**
   - Create a clean and user-friendly interface with input fields for Aadhar number, Driving License number, PAN card number, and Passport number.
   - Include a button to save these details locally on the device.
   - Implement a feature to view and edit the saved details.

2. **Download as Picture:**
   - Implement a feature to convert the saved details into an image.
   - Provide an option to download this image, making it easy for users to share their information when needed.

3. **Local Storage:**
   - Utilize the local storage of the device to save the entered details securely.
   - Ensure data persistence even if the user closes the app or restarts their device.

4. **Offline Functionality:**
   - Develop the PWA to function seamlessly without an internet connection.
   - Clearly communicate to the user when offline and guide them on how to use the app without connectivity.

5. **Security:**
   - Implement basic encryption techniques to secure the stored data on the device.
   - Apply best practices for handling sensitive information.

**Deliverables:**
1. Working PWA with the specified features.
2. Codebase hosted on a version control system (e.g., GitHub) with clear commit messages.
3. Brief documentation explaining the structure of the code, dependencies used, and any special considerations for deployment.

**Evaluation Criteria:**
1. Functionality: Does the app fulfill the specified requirements?
2. Usability: Is the user interface intuitive and easy to navigate?
3. Offline Capability: Does the app work seamlessly without an internet connection?
4. Security: How well is the user's sensitive information protected?
5. Code Quality: Is the code well-organized, documented, and follows best practices?

**Submission Guidelines:**
Submit the GitHub repository link and a short demo video showcasing the app's features.

**Important Note:**
Ensure the developer follows industry best practices and ethical considerations when dealing with sensitive personal information. Regularly update the mentor on progress and seek feedback to enhance the learning experience.
